# Implementation of Neural Encoding Algorithms of Spiking Neural Networks

SNNs are inspired by the brain's functioning which closely mimic the behavior of biological neurons, particularly its energy-efficient and parallel processing capabilities.The study explores various encoding techniques such as Rate coding, Phase coding, Burst and Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) coding using EEG signalsâ€™ dataset.

*Temporal coding strategies, such as TTFS (Time-To-First-Spike) coding, offer the fastest performance with lower latency and fewer operations compared to other encoding techniques. This makes them highly efficient.
*Rate coding, though stable, is less energy-efficient, while temporal coding and optimized hardware implementations, including FPGA-based designs, significantly reduce power consumption.
*Phase coding is represented by the relative timing or phase of spikes concerning a reference oscillatory pattern.
*Burst coding is a temporal coding strategy used in spiking neural networks (SNNs) where a neuron encodes information through a rapid sequence, or burst, of spikes.
